// 64. Minimum Path Sum

// Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

// Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

// Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
// Output: 7
// Explanation: Because the path 1 â†’ 3 â†’ 1 â†’ 1 â†’ 1 minimizes the sum.

  Application for Summer Internship on AI-Based Urban Traffic Dataset â€“ Kavya Kapoor

  Dear Professor [Last Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is Kavya Kapoor, and I am currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science at Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology, Delhi. I recently came across the call for the summer internship program on Building AI Datasets for Indian Urban Traffic Challenges, and I felt strongly compelled to write to you directly.

I have a strong passion for AI and computer vision, especially in solving real-world challenges with social impact. In one of my recent projects (BetterWeb), I developed an AI-powered Chrome extension to support users with cognitive impairments using the Gemini API, which taught me the importance of precision, context-awareness, and user-centric designâ€”qualities that directly apply to image annotation work.

This internship aligns perfectly with my interests and skill set. I am confident that my technical foundation, keen attention to detail, and eagerness to learn would allow me to contribute effectively to your research team. I am genuinely motivated by the prospect of working on a government-supported initiative at IISc and would be truly grateful for an opportunity to be mentored under your guidance.

I am also open to working in an unpaid capacityâ€”I value the learning experience and mentorship more than anything.

Thank you for considering my request. I have attached my resume for your reference, and Iâ€™d be happy to share any additional details you may need.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Warm regards,
Kavya Kapoor
B.Tech CSE, MAIT, Delhi
